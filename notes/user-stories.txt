User Stories

Below are the main user stories for this project. There are far too many stories then can be completed in one week, so you will need to prioritize what you will do.

On a real project, the Customer or the Product Owner will determine the priority and group stories into iterations. As such, the stories below have been grouped to give you a general idea of their importance. In addition, there is a project backlog (non-prioritized stories) at the end full of extra stuff that can be added if you have time. The stories in bold require AJAX in order to considered complete.

JavaScript/AJAX

Listed below are some of the areas of the application in which JavaScript and/or AJAX is to be used. Feel free to use JS in other areas of your application if you feel that it would be useful (or fun).

    When a backer funds a project, there should be a nice highlighted flash message that appears at the top of the screen and fades out after 20 seconds or so
    backing a project should be AJAX and not require a page refresh
    Leaving a comment for a project should involve AJAX
    After someone backs a project, the metrics (how many backers there are, how many backers at the breakpoints, etc) should update without needing a page refresh
    listing of comments, and backers, should use infinite scrolling instead of paging
    When searching for a project by name, the app should use autocomplete/typeahead
